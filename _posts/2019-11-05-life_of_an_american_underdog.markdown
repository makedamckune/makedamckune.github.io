>"***With but few expections, it is always the underdog who wins through sheer willpower.***"- *Johnny Weissmuller*

  <p>      According to the Oxford dictionary, the definition of an underdog is given two definitions. The first one states, >"a competiotor thought to have little chance of winning a fight or contest". While the second definition states, >"a person who has little status in society". The underdog term is a noun that is used to identify me. I am an underdog. Where ever I went, my work, character, and ablities were always underestimated. There have been numerous times in which my actions and/or intelligence surprised other people. Including myself.</p>
	<br>
	<p>			This can all be traced back to when primary school was still relevant in my life. Bullying, teasing, and embarrassing me were apart of the class routine. Even a few teachers were in on the "fun". It crippled me. To the point where giving in my projects, essays, and homework put fear in my heart. I didn't want to look stupid. Time went by. Eighth grade was my last year in middle school. Things did change. Thanks to the wonderful teachers that were present. History (particularly archeology) and English became a passion of mine. Math and Science weren't. My understanding of them were pretty low, and I still had the complex of not wanting to seem dumb. That would change within a year. </p>
	<br>
	<p>			My math teacher Ms.Toussaint was amazing. She graduated from MIT, and took my classmates and I on field trips to the Ivy League University. She pulled me to the side one day, and explained to me how much potential she thought that I had within me. She also explained that I've been failing her class. With this, a few orders came after. Afterschool one on one time were a must. No other options were given to me. This was all I needed to unlock my full potential. Within a few weeks, I became a tutor for the seniors, math exams were passed with flying colors, and I had this new sense of self that weren't present years prior. </p>
	<br>
			My status went from being the dumb kid, to the kid who worked her way up to being smart. Fast forward to today, my love for all subjects have grown. The greatest lesson ever taught, was for me to put the necessary work into my passions. From there, I can do anything I put my mind into. No matter the coding language. Life is all about learning. With time, patience,  and commitment, nothing can stop you from that dream. Till this day,others will still underestimate my abilities. However, I push myself until the end. Even though I may fail. Getting up and trying again is the only option. I'm working to becoming a better me everyday. While constantly reminding myself that even a lose, is a win.
