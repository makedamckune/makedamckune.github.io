>"***With but few expections, it is always the underdog who wins through sheer willpower.***"- *Johnny Weissmuller*

> > **>    <p>      According to the Oxford dictionary, the definition of an underdog is given two definitions. The first one states, "a competiotor thought to have little chance of winning a fight or contest". While the second definition states, "a person who has little status in society". The underdog term is a noun that is used to identify me. I am an underdog. Where ever I went, my work, character, and ablities were always underestimated. There have been numerous times in which my actions and/or intelligence surprised other people. Including myself.</p>

> > >  <p>  This can be traced back to when primary school was still relevant in my life. Bullying, teasing, and embarrassing me were apart of the class routine. Even a few teachers were in on the "fun".  It crippled me. To the point where giving in my projects, essays, and homework put fear in my heart. I didn't want to look stupid. Time went by. Eighth grade was my last year in middle school. Things did change. Thanks to the wonderful teachers that were present. History (particularly archeology) and English became a passion of mine. Math and Science were not. My understanding of the topics were pretty low, and  I still had a complex of not wanting to seem dumb. This will all change within a year.</p>

She pulled me to the side on day, and explained to me how much potential she thought that I had within me. She also explained to me that I was failing her class. With this, a few orders came after.  After school one on one time was a must. No other options was given to me. This was all i needed to unlock my full potential. Within a few weeks,  I became a tutor for the seniors, math exams were passed with flying colors, and I found a new sense of myself, that weren't present years prior.</p>

> >  >  <p>My status went from being the dumb kid, to kid who worked her way up to being smart. Fast foward to today, my love for all subjects have grown. The greatest lesson ever taught, was for me to put the nessecary work in to follow my passions. That's the only way to be successful in them. From there, I know I could do anything I put my mind to. No matter the coding language. Life is all about learning. With time, patience, and commitment, nothing can stop you from that dream. Till this day, others still underestimate my abilities. However, I push myself until the end. Even though I may fail. Getting up and trying again is the only option. I'm working to becoming a better me everyday. While constantly reminding myself that, even a lose, is a win.</p>**
